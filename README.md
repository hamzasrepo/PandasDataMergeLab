# PandasDataMergeLab
PandasDataMergeLab is a project focused on combining datasets using Pandas in a laboratory setting.

## Overview

This repository contains a Colab file (`Combining_Pandas_Datasets`) where I've practiced combining datasets using pandas.
In this Colab file, I demonstrate various techniques for merging, concatenating, and joining datasets using the Pandas library in Python. By following along with the code provided, you'll learn how to:
- Simply concatenate two DataFrames using the pd.concat() function.
- Utilize various parameters within the pd.concat() function.
- Combine DataFrames using pd.merge() function.
- Implement multiple types of joins using pd.merge().
- Utilize various parameters within the pd.merge() function.
- Apply the knowledge to a real-world case study.

## Usage

To get started, simply open the `Combining_Pandas_Datasets.ipynb` file in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment. Follow the step-by-step instructions and execute the code cells to see the dataset combination techniques in action.
